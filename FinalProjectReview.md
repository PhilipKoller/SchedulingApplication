## What did you do right?
Kept the application relatively simple.
## What did you do wrong?
I didn’t walk away when I got stuck on a particular problem which burnt a lot of time and energy. 
## Where were you lucky?
The help that I received from others.
## What would you change/ what do you know now that you wish you knew “then”?
I wish I would have known a little more about JavaScript because it is a core part in the functionally in 
my application.
